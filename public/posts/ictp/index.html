<h1>ICTP - Quantinuum Hackathon</h1>


<p><a href="https://www.ictp.it/news/2023/4/hackathon-prize-winners-announced">We won! (second place)</a>. After a week of lectures and 48 hours of intense coding and learning, I&rsquo;m proud to announce that our team was awarded the <strong>Best Team Project</strong> prize by <a href="https://www.quantinuum.com/">Quantinuum</a> and the <a href="https://www.ictp.it/">International Centre for Theoretical Physics</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://indico.ictp.it/event/10163">event&rsquo;s website</a>, &ldquo;<em>The ICTP-Quantinuum Quantum Hackathon invites 18 international teams of students to the International Centre for Theoretical Physics to learn and develop quantum algorithms and apply them in the context of real-world use-cases with leading industrial partners.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>My team and I worked on Quantum Krylov Methods with our mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M9JDf6sAAAAJ">Nathan Fitzpatrick</a> (from Quantinuum), in order to simulate an H\(_2\) molecule (it can be applied to other chains). This provided a significant advantage over a <em>variational</em> approach (as it is usually seen in tutorials for quantum computing in chemistry), as the algorithm is purely quantum.</p>
<p>Another advantage comes from the fact that with <em>variational</em> algorithms, your aim is to only calculate the ground state. With this method, however, we are able to reproduce excited state curves &ldquo;for free&rdquo;. These excited states come from the fact that this is a generalized eigenvalue problem in Krylov subspace, which is (supposed to be) much smaller than the total Hilbert space from the original diagonalization problem</p>
\[H|\psi\rangle=E|\psi\rangle\]<p>A small issue with the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Krylov Method (we used a Unitary Krylov Approach) is that, as your Krylov basis is purely in powers of functions of \(H\), e.g.</p>
\[\{|\psi_0\rangle, f(H)^1|\psi_0\rangle,f(H)^2|\psi_0\rangle, ..., f(H)^K|\psi_0\rangle \} \]<p>the basis becomes almost linearly dependent due to the <em>properties of power iteration</em>. This can be solved through an orthogonalization routine, as seen in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00567">this paper</a> that was published just after the hackathon. They use the Krylov space as a basis for the Lanczos method.</p>
<p>We used <a href="https://www.quantinuum.com/computationalchemistry/inquanto">InQuanto</a>, from <em>Quantinuum</em> in order to get the second quantization as a weighted linear combination of unitary Paulis (through the JW-transformation).</p>
