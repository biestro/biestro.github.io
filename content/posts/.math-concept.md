# The concept

This is a post about math. 

Here is a block equation:
$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

I also want to link to another note using WikiLink syntax. 
See my note on [[Linear Algebra]].

See [[Linear Algebra]]

(Note: You would need to create a post file named `linear-algebra.md` for this link to work perfectly).


```julia
import LinearAlgebra
import StaticArrays

SVector(2,2)
