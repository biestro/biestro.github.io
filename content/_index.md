I am a second-year PhD student in the Physics and Astronomy program at Rice University.

I enjoy bridging theory and computation in physics, particularly to design and understand solids (or condensed systems). 

Before coming to Rice, I completed my BSc. in Engineering Physics at Monterrey's Institute of Technology. My previous research focused on computational optics and quantum billiards.
