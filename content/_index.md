I am a second-year PhD student in the Physics and Astronomy program at Rice University.

I love condensed matter theory because I can leverage tools to design and understand solids. I believe we are only in the early ages of computing, and we have much to learn in how we use such tools. I have learnt that fun one can find fun physics and Hamiltonians in research areas outside of conventional physics.

Before coming to Rice, I completed my BSc. in Engineering Physics at Monterrey's Institute of Technology. My previous research focused on computational optics and quantum billiards.
