The Tight Binding (TB) approach consists of 
1. an assumption, and
2. a procedure.

The assumption is that the 

TB Hamiltonians are usually interpreted as having an electron *tunneling* or *hopping* between atoms, since going from an occupied to an unoccupied site should lower its energy (there is more space available). The energy change in tunneling from $n\rightarrow m$ is $-t_{nm}$,

$$
   \hat{H}=\sum_n\epsilon_n\ket{n}\bra{n}
$$
